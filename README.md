Overview

This repository documents my findings regarding a potential developer-centric debugging API and a hidden feature on the Titan OS, a web-based operating system used in certain Philips and JVC smart TVs. My investigation uncovered an accessible, undocumented URL and a hidden menu triggered by a Konami code, both of which provide a rare glimpse into the development process of the platform and a new streaming service.

1. The Developer Debugging API

My initial discovery centered on the URL: https://acc01.titanos.tv/.

    Access and Observation: This URL is accessible on all web browsers without any authentication or restrictions. The interface it loads is a live-looking version of the Titan OS home screen.

    Key Indicator: The most significant finding is that this interface contains features and content that are not yet available on the public, consumer version of the operating system.

    Conclusion: The subdomain "acc01" is a common abbreviation for "access control," often used in development or testing environments. Coupled with the lack of restrictions and the presence of unreleased features, this strongly suggests that the URL leads to a staging or debugging environment used by Titan OS developers to test new features before they are officially rolled out.

2. The "Freely" OS and the Konami Code Easter Egg

During my investigation, I discovered a hidden feature that could be accessed via the famous Konami code on the TV remote.

    The Code: When entering the Konami code (Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, OK, OK) with the TV's remote, a menu related to a platform called "Freely" appears.

    The Service: Freely is a new, UK-based, free-to-air streaming platform backed by major broadcasters. Recent news articles confirm that Freely is being implemented on Titan OS through a partnership with TV manufacturers.

    Conclusion: The presence of this pre-release service, accessible only through a hidden developer shortcut, is a classic "Easter egg" used in software development. This provides solid evidence that the TV's operating system has an intentional, built-in developer mode that is used for testing new features before they are ready for the public.

Summary of Findings

These two discoveries are closely linked. The hidden "Freely" menu, accessible via the Konami code, is a prime example of the kind of unreleased feature that would be tested on the debugging API at acc01.titanos.tv.
